I have a playload for a client as below :

{
    "Rogers": {
        "ClientId": "68758765789",
        "ClientSecret": "g435uyg354u8t8tg3hfsbj",
        "AuthenticationType": "SSO",
        "ChannelType": "External",
        "UserType": "Unknown",
        "PriorityOrder": 1
    }
}

also I have a json file containing all client details and client secret named, client_details.json.

Please create a powershell script which will take the client name(Rogers, in this client playload example) 
and search base client.json file and find same client, then check which "ChannelType = External", and update all value of it from input playload.

#################### Solution Outline #########################

below steps can be taken for implementing this:

1) create input.json file and put the client playload in the file.

2) create a file client_details.json, which contail your all client details.

3) write a powershell script which will put client name, client id, client secret etc into seperate variables.

4) use "jq" utility and search the client name which is same as playload client name.

5) for that client,search all clild items and search for "ChannelType = External" , once find it,
update all the parameter of it with playload values using previously stored variable.

6) store the modified output in a seperate file named updated_client_details.json


########### RUN THE SOLUTION ##############

open powershell CLI and then got to script directory(for me /Users/biprodatta/Documents/GitHub/aws/automations), then run below command :

./script.ps1


then it will create a json file named "updated_client_details.json" with updated client details from input.json playload file.
